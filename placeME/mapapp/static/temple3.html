                Erumbeeswarar Temple in Thiruverumbur, Tamil Nadu, India, is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva. 
                Built on a 60-foot (18 m) tall hill, it is accessible via a flight of steps. 
                The temple's main shrines and its two prakarams (outer courtyards) are on top of the hill, while a hall and the temple tank are located at the foothills. 
                Shiva is believed to have transformed himself into an ant hill and tilted his head at this place to enable ants to climb up and worship him. 
                Erumbeeswarar is revered in the canonical 7th-century Tamil Saiva work the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.
