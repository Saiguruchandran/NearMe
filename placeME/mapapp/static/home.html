                Tiruchchirappalli was an important regional capital of the Pallava, Chola, and Vijayanagar dynasties from the 7th to the 17th century. 
                Its rock fortress temple, dominating the city, was the scene of bitter fighting between Muslim, Maratha, British, and French troops from the 17th to the 19th century.
